        <p>The dog (Canis familiaris[4][5] or Canis lupus familiaris[5]) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the
          domestic dog, it is derived from extinct Pleistocene wolves,[6][7] and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living
          relative.[8] Dogs were the first species to be domesticated[9][8] by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago[7] before
          the development of agriculture</p>

      <p>The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal.[1][2] It is the only domesticated species in
        the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it from the wild members
        of the family.[4] Cats are commonly kept as house pets but can also be farm cats or feral cats; the feral cat ranges
        freely and avoids human contact.</p>
